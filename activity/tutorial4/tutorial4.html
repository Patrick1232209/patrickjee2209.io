<h2 style="color:red;">Short Story: <span style="color:orange;">The Shepherd Boy and the Wolf</span></h2>
<hr>

<p align=justify>
A <b><i>shepherd</i></b> boy in a village used to take his herd of sheep across the fields near the forest.
He felt this job was very dull and wanted to have some fun.
</p>

<p align=justify>
One day while <u>grazing</u> the sheep, he shouted, "Wolf! Wolf! The wolf is carrying away a lamb!"
Farmers working in the nearby fields came running for help but didn’t find any wolf.
</p>

<p align=justify>
The boy laughed and replied, "It was just fun. There is no wolf here".
<b><i>The boy played a similar trick repeatedly for many days.</i></b>
</p>

<p align=justify>
After some days, while the shepherd boy was in the field with the herd of sheep, suddenly, a wolf came out from the nearby forest and attacked one of the lambs.
The boy was frightened and cried loudly, "Wolf! Wolf! <strike>The wolf is carrying a lamb away!</strike>"
</p>

<font color="purple"><b>The farmers</b></font> <sub>thought</sub> <font color="blue"><b>the boy was playing</b></font> <i>mischief</i> again.
So, no one paid attention to him and didn’t come to his help.
